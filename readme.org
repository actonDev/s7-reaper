  Scripting [[https://www.reaper.fm/][REAPER]] with [[https://ccrma.stanford.edu/software/snd/snd/s7.html][s7 scheme]]. Side effect: A REPL over Emacs

  REAPER is already one of the (if not THE) most hacker-friendly DAW
  out there. So why not pair it with the most hacker-friendly
  text-editor/OS aka EMACS?

  This essentially creates s7 scheme bindings for [[https://www.reaper.fm/sdk/reascript/reascripthelp.html#c][Reaper's C API]]

  *HEAVILY UNDER DEVELOPMENT*
  
  For example, just recently I made a switch from SDL to SFML for the windowing system (in [[https://github.com/actonDev/s7-imgui][s7-imgui]] repo - not in master branch). Things are changing and this is like an MVP for now. Help wanted (see below)! Some input and/or help could lead to something (more) stable soon.

* Showcase
  REPL (with emacs)

  GUI (with dear imgui)

* Features
  - writing simple actions scripts
  - writing gui scripts with =s7= & =dear imgui=
  - REPL over a socket\\
    that can leverage emacs to remotely control reaper

* Help wanted
  The first step to make this happen was to create the basic skeleton
  to make =C++= applications with =s7 scheme= and =dear imgui=. [[https://github.com/actonDev/s7-imgui][Here]]
  is the relevant repo.

  In this repo I'm leveraging functionality from aforementioned
  repo. It would be great to at least discuss certain aspects of
  organization, libraries etc.

  Apart from this repo, I'm working on a framework to create =VST3=
  applications with =s7 scheme=.

  As you can see this grows and some input (if not help!) would be
  much appreciated.
