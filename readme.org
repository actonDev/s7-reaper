* S7 REAPER REPL
  REPL like functionality with [[https://ccrma.stanford.edu/software/snd/snd/s7.html][s7 scheme]] for [[https://www.reaper.fm/][REAPER]], easy to couple
  with EMACS.

  REAPER is already one of the (if not THE) most hacker-friendly DAW
  out there. So why not pair it with the most hacker-friendly
  text-editor/OS aka EMACS?
